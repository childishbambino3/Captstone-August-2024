My Project Overview

This is a data analyze stock market trends from 2020 to 2024 using historical stock data. It focuses on the performance of major technology companies and broader market indices to identify key trends and correlations.


Problem Statement

Stock market trends fluctuate due to various economic, political, and financial factors. Investors and analysts seek insights into the performance of major technology stocks and their correlation with broader market trends. This project aims to provide a data-driven analysis of MAANG stock performance and its relationship with external market forces.


Goals and Objectives

Goal 1: Analyze the performance of MAANG stocks relative to the broader market from 2020 to 2024.
Goal 2: Identify patterns in stock price trends and assess the impact of external factors such as commodities (oil, gold) and cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum)


Features

Core Features:
Load and clean historical stock market data.
Compute descriptive statistics for stock performance.
Generate visualizations (line charts, bar charts, scatter plots) to show trends.
Compare MAANG stocks to market indices (S&P 500, Nasdaq 100).

Stretch Goals:
Perform correlation analysis between stock prices and commodity/crypto prices.
Use predictive modeling (basic linear regression) to forecast stock trends.


Technologies

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas
Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook, VS Code

Analysis: Identify trends, correlations, and insights.
Conclusion & Recommendations: Summarize findings and propose future research.


Timeline

Week 1: Define project scope, collect datasets.
Week 2: Load and clean data, handle missing values.
Week 3: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Week 4: Generate visualizations, identify trends.
Week 5: Summarize insights, finalize documentation.
Week 6: Review and submit the final project.


Risks and Mitigation Strategies


Incomplete or messy data: I will have to preprocess and clean data before analysis
Performance issues with large datasets: I will use optimized Pandas functions. If not, I will lean on all resources, including AI, to help find inefficiencies in the work I am trying to complete.
Inaccurate findings: I will research to validate insights using multiple visualizations


Test/Evaluation Plan

I want to have consistency of insights with real-world stock trends. I want my mentor's feedback on analysis and conclusions. I want it to work.
